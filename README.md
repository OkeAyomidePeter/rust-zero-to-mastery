# Rust Zero to Mastery

This repository contains 100 progressively challenging Rust projects. The goal is to help learners move past passive tutorials and gain real experience with memory safety, ownership, lifetimes, concurrency, and systems-level thinking. Each project is organized in its own numbered folder and includes a detailed `README.md` for clarity.

Projects start with basics like variables, pattern matching, and simple command-line tools. They grow into topics such as file parsing, multi-threading, async runtime design, networking, serialization, and performance tuning. Along the way, you will see Rust’s strengths and tradeoffs in real contexts.

All code in this repository is heavily commented and annotated to support problem-solving and deep understanding. The intent is to teach reasoning, not guesswork, and to help break out of “tutorial hell” by showing how real Rust programs evolve.

Video walkthroughs may be added when a project benefits from visual explanation or involves complex mental models.

## Roadmap

- Add optional video walkthroughs for complex systems
- Introduce testing and benchmarking
- Highlight unsafe code boundaries
- Add prompts for self-reflection after each build

## Goals

- Build by doing, not watching
- Understand ownership through real examples
- Develop confidence in reading, writing, and refactoring Rust
- Learn systems-level tradeoffs
- Gain technical range from simple utilities to full applications

Start at the first folder. Move forward only when the concepts are comfortable. Consistency beats speed.
